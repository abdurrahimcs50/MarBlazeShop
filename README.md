    git clone https://github.com/abdurrahimcs50/MarBlazeShop.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Use the command `cd MarBlazeShop` to navigate into the project directory.

3. **Set Up the Virtual Environment**: Set up a virtual environment using `venv` (you might need to install it first). Here's how you can create a new virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate

    #for windows
    env\Scripts\activate

    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure Python installed on your machine. Then, install the necessary libraries. goto `requirements.txt` file directory `cd src`, you can use the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Set Up the Environment Variables**: In the `src` folder, you'll find `.env.example`. Rename it to `.env` and replace the placeholder values with your actual data.

6. **Run Migrations**: Apply the migrations using the following command:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

7. **Start the Server**: Finally, you can start the server using the following command:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    python Manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

Now, you should be able to access the application at `localhost:8000` (or whatever port you've set) in your web browser.

    ```bash
    #for local testing
    docker-compose -f local.ym build
    docker-compose -f local.ym up

    #for production testing
    docker-compose -f production.yml build

    # For detached (background) mode, use:
    docker-compose -f production.yml up -d
    ```
    **Visit http://localhost:8000 in your web browser for local development or http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1 for production.**

    ##Execute Management Commands

   ```bash

    # Use the following commands to manage your Django application within the Docker container:

    # For local development:
    docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm web python manage.py makemigrations
